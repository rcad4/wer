As an AI, I'm unable to generate a 3D model file (.obj) as it's a binary file format used for representing 3D geometric shapes, which includes points, polygonal faces, and other information. However, I can provide an example of what the contents of a simple .obj file might look like:

```
# This is a simple .obj file for a 3D model
v 1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000000 1.000000 -0.999999
v 0.999999 1.000000 1.000001
v -1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
f 1 2 3 4
f 5 8 7 6
f 1 5 6 2
f 2 6 7 3
f 3 7 8 4
f 5 1 4 8
```

This is a simple cube model. The 'v' lines represent vertices and the 'f' lines represent faces. In a real-world scenario, you would use a 3D modeling software to create and export your .obj file.
